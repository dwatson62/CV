## Daryl Watson

Enthusiastic new coder eagerly looking for a stimulating and rewarding career in technology. I have recently completed the Makers Academy coding bootcamp and now assist other students with their coding. Currently I am looking to pursue a position with a forward thinking company who I can offer value to, and to help me learn and grow as a junior developer.

## Favourite Technologies

#### Ruby

Ruby was the second programming language I learnt (after Visual Basic), and my favourite so far, due to its ability to read like English, elegance and for the range of methods available. I particularly enjoy the beauty of using recursion with Ruby to solve problems, such as this one from codewars: (http://www.codewars.com/kata/551186edce486caa61000f5c)

def count_squares(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  (n * n) + count_squares(n - 1)
end
~~~

#### Angular

Angular was the first Javascript framework I learnt, and what I am currently practising. The more I use Angular the more I enjoy using it, and can appreciate the simplicity of an SPA.

## Skills

I asked my fellow students what their opinion of me was, and here are theire responses

## Education

#### Makers Academy (27/04/15 to 17/07/15)

Makers Academy is a highly selective coding bootcamp that accepts only the top ten percent of applicants. For 12 weeks, the course focuses heavily on programming practices such as TTD, pair-programming and problem solving, whilst teaching a variety of technologies. This experience has nurtured my passion for code and taught me about software craftmanship, and to take pride in well-designed code. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Makers, so much so that I have stayed on as an Alumni Helper to assist new students in their learning.

#### Luton Sixth Form College (09/04 to 06/06)

- A Level Maths with Statistics (B)
- A Level Music (B)
- A Level English Literature (C)
- AS Level Computing (B)

I studied AS Level Computing for 1 year, with the language taught being Visual Basic. The coding side of the course I greatly enjoyed, and received near full marks for my final project. However, the theory side did not interest me at that point in my life, so I did not pursue the course for a second year.

#### Any other qualifications

- 7 GCSEs, including ICT (A), Maths (B) and English Language (B)
