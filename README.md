## Daryl Watson

Highly enthusiastic new coder eagerly looking for a stimulating and rewarding career in technology. Driven by my newfound passion, I quit my previous career in order to complete the Makers Academy coding bootcamp and to begin a new adventure. I love to code and discover new possiblities, and I am now pursuing a position in a company where I can continue to learn and grow as a junior developer, and with whom I can offer my upmost to.

## Favourite Technologies

#### Ruby

Ruby was the second programming language I learnt, and my favourite so far, due to its ability to read like English, elegance and for the range of methods available. I particularly enjoy the beauty of using recursion with Ruby to solve problems, such as this one from codewars: (http://www.codewars.com/kata/551186edce486caa61000f5c)

def count_squares(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  (n * n) + count_squares(n - 1)
end
~~~

#### Angular

Angular was the first Javascript framework I learnt, and what I am currently practising. The more I use Angular the more I enjoy using it, and can appreciate the simplicity of an SPA. I'm very interested in learning more about the MEAN stack, because I love the idea of being able to use Javascript on the server side, and to directly link that with the front end.

I asked my fellow students what their opinion of me was, and here are their responses

## Education

#### Makers Academy (27/04/15 to 17/07/15)

Makers Academy is a highly selective coding bootcamp that accepts only the top ten percent of applicants. For 12 weeks, the course focuses heavily on programming practices such as TTD, pair-programming and problem solving, whilst teaching a variety of technologies. This experience has nurtured my passion for code and taught me about best practices in software craftmanship, and to take pride in well-designed code. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Makers, and have learnt so much. Currently I am staying on temporarily as an alumni helper to help new students with their coding, whilst continuing to learn and practice my own skills.

#### Luton Sixth Form College (09/04 to 06/06)

- A Level Maths with Statistics (B)
- A Level Music (B)
- A Level English Literature (C)
- AS Level Computing (B)

I studied AS Level Computing for 1 year, with the language taught being Visual Basic. The coding side of the course I greatly enjoyed, and received near full marks for my final project. However, the theory side did not interest me at that point in my life, so I did not pursue the course for a second year.

#### Other qualifications

- 7 GCSEs, including ICT (A), Maths (B) and English Language (B)
