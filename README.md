## Skills

#### Enjoys learning new things

I relish the opportunity to learn and try new things, not just in programming but in all aspects of life. Aside from my current work requirements, when I have time to spare I have experimented with numerous different technologies, including Python, Haskell, React, Angular and Ionic. My ideal position would involve regularly experimenting with new languages and frameworks, as I believe a more diverse knowledge base makes for a more efficient problem solver. In addition, the best way I find to learn is by creating new projects with a technology. For example in my casino project above, I needed to learn how to create my own RESTful API using MongoDB to provide data about the players in the game, such as their name and current balance, and how to utilise this so the game can automatically update a player's balance after each round of betting.

#### Problem solver

I enjoy solving problems and have developed a slight addiction to CodeWars with more than 850 points. Creating my scrabble project above I found to be a highly enjoyable problem to solve (having made two different solutions). The main challenge in building scrabble is in knowing which letters and tiles are in play, and being able to calculate the correct ones in the correct order, sometimes with multiple words being played in multiple directions. I found the best way to solve this was by using a lot of recursion.

#### Strong communicator

I have experience of morning stand-ups and communicating clearly what I am working on each day, even to non-tech colleagues, and slack is an important part of our company workflow. In my previous career as a hotel bartender, my role demanded excellent levels of communication between colleagues. Passing on correct and specific information quickly, such as customer allergies, preferences and payment, was essential to the business and for providing a five star service. No matter how hectic or busy service was, correct and precise communication was vital. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (27/04/15 to 17/07/15)

Makers Academy is a highly selective coding bootcamp that accepts only the top ten percent of applicants. For 12 weeks, the course focuses heavily on programming practices such as TDD, pair-programming and problem solving, whilst teaching a variety of technologies. This experience has nurtured my passion for code and taught me about best practices in software craftsmanship, and to take pride in well-designed code. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Makers, and have learnt so much. After finishing my course, I stayed on an extra six weeks as an alumni helper, to improve my own understanding and to be the first point of contact to new students when they needed help.

#### Luton Sixth Form College (09/04 to 06/06)

- A Level Maths with Statistics (B)
- A Level Music (B)
- A Level English Literature (C)
- AS Level Computing (B)

I studied AS Level Computing for one year, with the language taught being Visual Basic. The coding side of the course I greatly enjoyed and I received 86/90 for my final project. However, the theory side did not interest me at that point in my life, so I concentrated on other subjects for the second year.

#### Other qualifications

- 7 GCSEs, including ICT (A), Maths (B) and English Language (B)

## Travel

- Two years travelling and working in a variety of roles across Australia and New Zealand
- Learnt to be adaptable to different cities and countries. I needed to be a go-getter, arriving in a new city every few months with little money and knowing nobody, to quickly find work and a social circle. 
- Communication skills were important and I learnt to meet and work with a variety of people from across the world.
- Also spent five months traveling throughout southeast Asia and am well-travelled across Europe
